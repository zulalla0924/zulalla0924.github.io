FIRE E5CAPE</p><p>	In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at </p><p>	her.  She can only go up.</p><p>	EXT.  ROOF</p><p>	On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over </p><p>	the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.</p><p>	Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her </p><p>	moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,</p><p>	contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.</p><p>	Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.</p><p>	The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity </p><p>	turns to it, racing for the back of the building.</p><p>	The edge falls away into a wide back alley.

The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a </p><p>	rattling blur of gray metal.  Trinity junps, landing</p><p>	easily.</p><p>	She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air </p><p>	barely reaching the last car</p><p>	Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.</p><p>	Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.</p><p>	Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point </p><p>	where the train has begun to turn, there is --</p><p>	A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick</p><p>	building.</p><p>	Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her </p><p>	speed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL </p><p>	rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the</p><p>	turn.</p><p>	Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body </p><p>	leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head</p><p>	as --</p><p>	The whole world seems to spin on its axis --</p><p>	And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then </p><p>	falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down</p><p>	stairs bleeding, broken --</p><p>	But still alive.</p><p>	Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,</p><p>	still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the</p><p>	wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train </p><p>	slides him past the window.</p><p>	Trinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.</p><p>					TRINITY</p><p>			Get up, Trinity.  You&apos;re fine.</p><p>			Get up -- just get up!</p><p>	She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.</p><p>	EXT.

Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.</p><p>	There is no body.

They stop outside room 1313.</p><p>					TRINITY</p><p>			This is it.</p><p>	Neo can hear his own heart pounding.</p><p>					TRINITY</p><p>			Let me give one piece of advice.</p><p>			Be honest.  He knows more than you</p><p>			can possibly imagine.</p><p>	INT.  ROOM 1313</p><p>	Across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall</p><p>	windows veiled with decaying lace.  He turns and his</p><p>	smile lights up the room.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			At last.</p><p>	He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible</p><p>	behind circular mirrored glasses.</p><p>	He strides to Neo and they shake hands.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt</p><p>			have guessed, I am Morpheus.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			It&apos;s an honor.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Please.  Come.  Sit.</p><p>	He nods to Trinity.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Thank you, Trinity.</p><p>	She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an</p><p>	adjacent room.</p><p>	They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-</p><p>	leather chairs.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			I imagine, right now, you must be</p><p>			feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling</p><p>			down the rabbit hole?</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			You could say that.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			I can see it in your eyes.  You</p><p>			have the look of a man who accepts</p><p>			what he sees because he is</p><p>			expecting to wake up.</p><p>	A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Ironically, this is not far from</p><p>			the truth.  But I&apos;m getting ahead</p><p>			of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,</p><p>			why are you here?</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			You&apos;re Morpheus, you&apos;re a legend.</p><p>			Most hackers would die to meet</p><p>			you.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we</p><p>			both know there&apos;s more to it than </p><p>			that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			No.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Why not?</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			Because I don&apos;t like the idea that</p><p>			I&apos;m not in control of my life.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			I know exactly what you mean.</p><p>	Again, that smile that could cut glass.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Let me tell you why you are here.</p><p>			You are here because you have the</p><p>			gift.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			What gift?</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			I&apos;ve watched you, Neo.  You do not</p><p>			use a computer like a tool.  You</p><p>			use it like it was part of</p><p>			yourself.  What you can do inside</p><p>			a computer is not normal.  I know.</p><p>			I&apos;ve seen it.  What you do is</p><p>			magic.</p><p>	Neo shrugs.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			It&apos;s not magic.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			But it is, Neo.  It is.  How else</p><p>			would you describe what has been</p><p>			happening to you?</p><p>	He leans forward.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			We are trained in this world to</p><p>			accept only what is rational and</p><p>			logical.  Have you ever wondered</p><p>			why?</p><p>	Neo shakes his head.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			As children, we do not separate</p><p>			the possible from the impossible</p><p>			which is why the younger a mind is</p><p>			the easier it is to free while a</p><p>			mind like yours can be very</p><p>			difficult.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			Free from what?</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			From the Matrix.</p><p>	Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of</p><p>	himself.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Do you want to know what it is,</p><p>			Neo?</p><p>	Neo swallows and nods his head.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			It&apos;s that feeling you have had all</p><p>			your life.  That feeling that</p><p>			something was wrong with the</p><p>			world.  You don&apos;t know what it is</p><p>			but it&apos;s there, like a splinter in</p><p>			your mind, driving you mad,</p><p>			driving you to me.  But what is</p><p>			it?</p><p>	The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			The Matrix is everywhere, it&apos;s all</p><p>			around us, here even in this room.</p><p>			You can see it out your window, or</p><p>			on your television.  You feel it</p><p>			when you go to work, or go to</p><p>			church or pay your taxes.  It is</p><p>			the world that has been pulled</p><p>			over your eyes to blind you from</p><p>			the truth.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			What truth?</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			That you are a slave, Neo.  That</p><p>			you, like everyone else, was born</p><p>			into bondage...</p><p>			... kept inside a prison that you</p><p>			cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A</p><p>			prison for your mind.</p><p>	Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Unfortunately, no one can be told</p><p>			what the Matrix is.  You have to</p><p>			see it for yourself.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			How?</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Hold out your hands.</p><p>	In Neo&apos;s right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			This is your last chance.  After</p><p>			this, there is no going back.</p><p>	In his left, a blue pill.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			You take the blue pill and the</p><p>			story ends.  You wake in your bed</p><p>			and you believe whatever you want</p><p>			to believe.</p><p>	The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			You take the red pill and you stay</p><p>			in Wonderland and I show you how</p><p>			deep the rabbit-hole goes.</p><p>	Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the</p><p>	moisture growing in his palms.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Remember that all I am offering is</p><p>			the truth.  Nothing more.</p><p>	Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The</p><p>	Cheshire smile returns.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Follow me.</p><p>	He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with</p><p>	high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green</p><p>	from the racks of monitors.</p><p>	Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.</p><p>					CYPHER</p><p>			Shit.</p><p>					TRINITY</p><p>			I knew he would.</p><p>	Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone</p><p>	away from, Neo.</p><p>					CYPHER</p><p>			Morpheus, I know what you believe</p><p>			but I think this is a mistake.</p><p>			We&apos;re rushing him.  He&apos;s old.  I&apos;m</p><p>			afraid he might pop.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Haven&apos;t I always told you, Cypher,</p><p>			not to let fear control your life.</p><p>			Apoc, are we on-line?</p><p>	Neo recognizes the large man from the El train.</p><p>					APOC</p><p>			Almost.</p><p>	He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex</p><p>	system of monitors, modules and drives.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen</p><p>			Virus.</p><p>					APOC</p><p>			That&apos;s right.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Neo, time is always against us.</p><p>			Will you take a seat there?</p><p>	In the center of the room sits a chair.  Near the chair</p><p>	is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			I imagine you know sonething about</p><p>			virtual reality.</p><p>	Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode</p><p>	disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			A little.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Tell me about it.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			Essentially, it&apos;s a hardware</p><p>			system that uses an apparatus;</p><p>			headgear, gloves and whatever to</p><p>			make you feel that you are in a</p><p>			computer program.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			If the virtual reality apparatus,</p><p>			as you called it, was wired to all</p><p>			of your senses and controlled them</p><p>			completely, would you be able to</p><p>			tell the difference between the</p><p>			virtual world and the real world?</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			You might not, no.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			No, you wouldn&apos;t.</p><p>	Neo whispers to Trinity.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			You did all this?</p><p>	She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.</p><p>	They are wired to an old hotel phone.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			The pill you took is part of a</p><p>			trace program.  It&apos;s going to make</p><p>			things feel a bit strange.</p><p>	Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING</p><p>	on a KEYBOARD.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and</p><p>	twitch when he notices the mirror.</p><p>	Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a</p><p>	webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the</p><p>	mirror were becoming liquid.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			Shit...</p><p>	Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent</p><p>	data.  Trinity monitors Neo&apos;s electric vital signs.</p><p>	Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers</p><p>	disappear beneath the rippling surface.</p><p>	Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror</p><p>	stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy</p><p>	stuck to his fingertips.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			What is this?  Mescaline?</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Just relax, Neo.</p><p>	The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,</p><p>	until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.</p><p>	With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes</p><p>	of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and</p><p>	fade.</p><p>	He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored</p><p>	icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running</p><p>	like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms</p><p>	where he sees his face reflected.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			Uh-oh...</p><p>					TRINITY</p><p>			It&apos;s going into replication.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Apoc?</p><p>					APOC</p><p>			Still nothing.</p><p>	Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Tank, we&apos;re going to need the</p><p>			signal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.</p><p>	The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up</p><p>	his arns like hundreds of insects.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			It&apos;s cold.</p><p>	The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,</p><p>	tipping his head as though he were sinking into the</p><p>	mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			It&apos;s all over me --</p><p>	Morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.</p><p>					TRINITY</p><p>			I got a fibrillation!</p><p>					CYPHER</p><p>			I knew it, I knew it...</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Shit!  Apoc?</p><p>	Streams of mercury run from Neo&apos;s nose.</p><p>					APOC</p><p>			Targeting... almost there.</p><p>	An ALARM, on Trinity&apos;s monitor ERUPTS.</p><p>					TRINITY</p><p>			He&apos;s going into arrest!</p><p>					CYPHER</p><p>			He&apos;s gonna pop!</p><p>					APOC</p><p>			Lock!  I got him!</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			Now, Tank now!</p><p>	His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a</p><p>	high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --</p><p>	It is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to</p><p>	another computer --</p><p>	Neo&apos;s body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were</p><p>	pulled into the holes of the phone</p><p>	Sucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.</p><p>	INT.  POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN&apos;S BODY</p><p>	Floating in a womb-red amnion.</p><p>	His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.</p><p>	Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure</p><p>	his face.  Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs</p><p>	and cover his genitals.</p><p>	He is struggling desperately now.  Air bubbles into the</p><p>	Jell-O but does not break the surface.</p><p>	Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red</p><p>	rubber coccon.</p><p>	Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at</p><p>	the thinning elastic shroud --</p><p>	Until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he</p><p>	sucks for air.  Tearing himself free, he emerges from the</p><p>	cell.</p><p>	It is Neo.</p><p>	He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.</p><p>	Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.</p><p>	He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled</p><p>	with red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified</p><p>	like curdled milk.</p><p>	The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear</p><p>	to be grafted to his flesh.</p><p>	He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the</p><p>	back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial</p><p>	plugged and locked into the base of his skull.</p><p>	He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull</p><p>	off a finger.</p><p>	To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with</p><p>	red gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and</p><p>	motionless, he sees other human beings.</p><p>	Fanning out in a circle, there are more.  All connected</p><p>	to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing</p><p>	petal attached to a black metal stem.</p><p>	Above him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly</p><p>	forever.  He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks</p><p>	out.</p><p>	The image assaults his mind.</p><p>	Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible</p><p>	heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an</p><p>	underwater abyss.</p><p>	His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the</p><p>	intensity of the vision.  The sound of the PLANT is like</p><p>	the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of</p><p>	Leviathan.</p><p>	Below Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away</p><p>	the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a</p><p>	new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space.</p><p>	Inside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and</p><p>	pinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby.</p><p>	From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.</p><p>	He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.</p><p>	It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful</p><p>	housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems</p><p>	of hard and soft polymers.</p><p>	A black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain</p><p>	as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired</p><p>	to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex.</p><p>	At the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens,</p><p>	disengaging.</p><p>	The cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle</p><p>	and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull</p><p>	with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.  The other</p><p>	connective hoses snap free and snake away as --</p><p>	The back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like</p><p>	an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo</p><p>	into a black hole.</p><p>	INT.  WASTE LINE</p><p>	The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls,</p><p>	sliding with the clot of gelatin.</p><p>	Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up</p><p>	through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of</p><p>	cellulite.</p><p>	Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the</p><p>	flow of waste.</p><p>	The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the</p><p>	belly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside</p><p>	the sewer main line.</p><p>	INT.

The only place</p><p>			humans can survive outside the</p><p>			Matrix is underground.</p><p>	Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the</p><p>	chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert.</p><p>	Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			What happened?</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			It started early in the twenty-</p><p>			first century, with the birth of</p><p>			artificial intelligence, a</p><p>			singular consciousness that</p><p>			spawned an entire race of</p><p>			machines.</p><p>	In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			At first all they wanted was to be</p><p>			treated as equals, entitled to the</p><p>			same human inalienable rights.</p><p>			Whatever they were given, it was</p><p>			not enough.</p><p>	In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light</p><p>	up a bloody battle field.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			We don&apos;t know who struck first.</p><p>			Us or them.  But sometime at the</p><p>			end of the twenty-first century</p><p>			the battle was joined.</p><p>	We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			The war raged for generations and</p><p>			turned the face of our planet from</p><p>			green and blue to black and red.</p><p>	At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are</p><p>	at once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic</p><p>	architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is</p><p>	perpetually in motion.</p><p>	The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier,</p><p>	splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			It scorched and burned the sky.</p><p>			Without the sun, the machines</p><p>			sought out a new energy source to</p><p>			survive.</p><p>	The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink</p><p>	bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud</p><p>	of stain.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			They discovered a new form of</p><p>			fusion.  All that was required to</p><p>			initiate the reaction was a small</p><p>			electric charge.  Throughout human</p><p>			history we have been dependent on</p><p>			machines to survive.  Fate, it</p><p>			seems, is not without a sense of</p><p>			irony.</p><p>	We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where</p><p>	we see human beings looking almost blissful in their</p><p>	gelatin cocoons.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			The human body generates more bio-</p><p>			electricity than a 120-volt</p><p>			battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.&apos;s</p><p>			of body heat.</p><p>	Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a</p><p>	breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			We are, as an energy source,</p><p>			easily renewable and completely</p><p>			recyclable, the dead liquified and</p><p>			fed intravenously to the living.</p><p>	Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			All they needed to control this</p><p>			new battery was something to</p><p>			occupy our mind.</p><p>	We see inside a clear tubular husk.  Floating in viscous</p><p>	fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already</p><p>	growing around the brain-jack.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			And so they built a prison out of</p><p>			our past, wired it to our brains</p><p>			and turned us into slaves.</p><p>	We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television</p><p>	and we are again inside the white space of the Construct.</p><p>					NEO</p><p>			No!

That is why there are</p><p>			those of us that have spent our</p><p>			entire lives searching the Matrix,</p><p>			looking for him.</p><p>	Neo can feel his eyes on him.</p><p>					MORPHEUS</p><p>			I did what I did, because I</p><p>			believe we have been brought here</p><p>			for a reason, Neo.
